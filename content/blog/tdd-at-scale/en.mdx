After years of applying TDD in projects of different sizes, there's one truth I constantly repeat:

> TDD is not a testing technique. It's a **design** technique.

## The Common Mistake

Most teams that "try" TDD abandon it because they see it as "writing tests first." And sure, that feels like extra work.

But the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle has a deeper purpose:

1. **Red**: Define the behavior you need
2. **Green**: Implement the minimum to make it work
3. **Refactor**: Improve the design without changing behavior

The magic is in step 3. Constant refactoring, protected by tests, produces **simple and maintainable** code.

## TDD in Teams of 20+ People

In a large team, TDD is not optional. It's **survival**:

- Tests are executable documentation
- Anyone can modify code with confidence
- Integrations stop being scary

```typescript
// A well-named test is documentation
it('should_reject_transfer_when_insufficient_balance', () => {
  const account = new Account({ balance: 100 });
  
  expect(() => account.transfer(150)).toThrow(InsufficientFunds);
});
```

## Start Today

You don't need to convince the whole team. Start yourself:

1. Write a test before your next bug fix
2. Observe how it changes the way you think
3. Share the results

TDD spreads when people see the benefits.
