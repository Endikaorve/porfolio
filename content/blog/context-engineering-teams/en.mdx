The term **Context Engineering** is revolutionizing how development teams work with generative AI tools. But what does it really mean to implement it at scale in a team of more than 20 developers working on critical banking infrastructure?

## From "Vibe Coding" to Context Engineering

When generative AI started integrating into our development workflows, I observed a concerning pattern: developers were using the tools **intuitively but inconsistently**. Everyone had their own "style" of prompting, their own tricks, and highly variable results.

> The problem wasn't the AI. It was that we were doing "vibe coding" instead of engineering.

The difference is fundamental:

- **Vibe Coding**: Ad-hoc prompts, hoping the AI "understands" what we want
- **Context Engineering**: Systematic design of the context the AI needs to produce consistent, quality results

## The Three Pillars of Our Strategy

### 1. Rules: The Project's DNA

**Rules** are configuration files that define persistent context for the AI. In our case, we created a hierarchy of rules:

```typescript
// .cursor/rules/architecture.mdc
// Hexagonal architecture rules
- Use cases go in /application
- Ports are defined as interfaces in /domain
- Adapters implement ports in /infrastructure
- NEVER import from infrastructure in domain

// .cursor/rules/testing.mdc
// Testing strategy
- TDD: always test first
- Naming: should_[expected]_when_[condition]
- One assert per test
- Mocks only at boundaries
```

The impact was immediate: the AI stopped suggesting code that violated our architecture. Juniors started receiving contextualized guidance on where to place each piece of code.

### 2. Custom Commands

We defined specific commands for repetitive tasks:

```bash
# /generate-component
Generate a React component following:
- Atomic Design (specify level)
- Props typed with TypeScript
- Tests with Testing Library
- Storybook story included
```

This **standardized the quality** of generated code. It no longer depended on each developer's prompting skills.

### 3. MCPs (Model Context Protocols)

Integration with **Azure DevOps** through MCPs was a game-changer:

- The AI can query the current work context
- Accesses project documentation
- Knows team standards automatically

## Impact Metrics

After 6 months of progressive implementation:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average PR review time | 4.2h | 1.8h | -57% |
| Production bugs | 12/sprint | 4/sprint | -67% |
| Junior onboarding | 3 weeks | 1.5 weeks | -50% |
| Team satisfaction | 6.8/10 | 8.9/10 | +31% |

## Lessons Learned

### What worked

1. **Start small**: We piloted with 3 developers before scaling
2. **Iterate fast**: Rules evolved weekly at first
3. **Document decisions**: Each rule has an associated "why"
4. **Train the team**: Having the tools isn't enough, you need to know how to use them

### What did NOT work

1. **Rules that are too long**: The AI partially ignores them
2. **Automating everything**: Some workflows need human judgment
3. **Ignoring feedback**: The best rules came from the team

## The Future of Context Engineering

We're in the early days of this discipline. What seems cutting-edge today will be table stakes tomorrow.

My prediction: **teams that master Context Engineering will have a brutal competitive advantage** in delivery speed, code quality, and talent attraction.

## Resources to Get Started

If you want to implement Context Engineering in your team:

1. Start with 3-5 basic architecture rules
2. Document your existing code conventions
3. Identify repetitive tasks that could become commands
4. Measure before and after

AI won't replace developers. But developers who know how to work with AI will replace those who don't.
