description: 'What I learned building a portfolio with AI. On iteration, context, and why taste matters more than ever.'
---

I'd been going back and forth on having my own space online for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more... mine.

Building something like this today is easier than ever. I've been using AI in my day-to-day for a while now —large projects, clear rules, business constraints— and there's something that hooks you: the speed, being able to try ideas without the cost of before. I keep wanting to build more things. Any excuse is a good one, and this was perfect: something of my own, with full control from the start.

These are the reflections I'm taking away.

## The default is generic

Today any developer is 5 prompts away from having a nice personal website. Hero with gradient, cards with icons, smooth entrance animations, fully responsive. It works. It's correct. And it smells like AI from the first scroll.

When I started, as usual, I asked V0. It gave me exactly that: something correct, generic, soulless. A template with my data. I could have published it as is and nothing would have happened. It was fine. But it wasn't mine.

## Two ways of building

In my day-to-day, in projects with clear rules, AI is devastating for most tasks. Predictable code, one-shots, bread and butter stuff. For that it's spectacular.

But this portfolio wasn't that. I didn't know where it was going until I got into it. I had to explore, to discover as I went. I didn't want one-shots, they weren't helping. It's a different kind of building. And it requires a different way of working.

## The feedback loop

With AI you can validate an idea in minutes. Keep what works, discard what doesn't, ask for variations, combine parts from different responses. That used to have a cost. Now it's almost free.

This portfolio has about 190 commits. In about 28 hours of effective work. Small steps, one after another. I didn't write a single line of code manually. But I also didn't settle for the first thing the AI gave me. Or the second. Or often the tenth.

The AI generates. I direct. Reject, ask for something else, give context, iterate. But for that cycle to work, the AI has to understand what I'm looking for.

## Building context

For the AI to give me what I want, I had to understand it myself first. Define how I write. How I think. What I reject. What represents me.

And I'm not just talking about code. In a website, the container matters as much as the content. The architecture, the design, the animations. But also the copy, the tone, the way you tell things. Everything has to be coherent. It has to feel personal.

That turned into documents. A `/me` command that explains who I am. A design philosophy that defines what this site is and isn't. Style guides for the writing. Context that the AI needs to stop giving me the generic stuff.

I didn't start with that. It emerged from necessity. From the process of iterating and seeing that without that context, the responses wouldn't converge.

## Good design is no longer expensive

Martin Fowler has [a classic article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) about the cost of quality. It includes a graph that sums up the idea: well-designed systems take longer at first, but from a certain point they outpace poorly designed ones in development speed. The lines cross.

With AI, that point comes much sooner. Almost from the start.

This website uses hexagonal architecture for everything blog-related. Testing. Separation of concerns. Things that used to require discipline and extra time. Now, with good rules and references, it costs the AI the same to do it right as to do it wrong.

And not just that. A predictable system is predictable for everyone: for developers and for the AI. In chaotic code, the AI has to guess where everything goes. In a clean architecture, the pattern is so clear that it becomes more precise. Good design is no longer just for humans.

It's no longer a long-term investment. It's the starting point.

## _Taste_, here too

Linus Torvalds has a famous talk where he shows, with code, two ways to solve the same problem. Both work, but only one shows good _taste_: it's more elegant, eliminates unnecessary complexity. It's not knowing more. It's seeing differently.

Since I started working with AI, this term has resonated with me a lot. We look to optimize workflows, standardize. We create rules, commands, work strategies. And that's the right thing to do, it's the foundation. But it's not everything.

That's where _taste_ comes in. The "eye". Sensing where it's going to go before it goes. Knowing what not to say so you don't influence it. What to say even when it seems unnecessary. When to stop and when to keep iterating.

That's earned with the hours. There's no shortcut.

## The other multiplier

There's a phrase that gets repeated a lot: "AI is a multiplier". Usually, when people say this, they mean the ability to generate code, for better or worse. But there's another multiplier that gets less attention and I find almost as important: the motivation.

Lately I see problems I would have let go before and think: I can solve this. I want to solve it. An internal tool I always wanted to build. A spike to test an idea. This website. Things that weren't worth it because of the time they'd take. Now I see them as viable. And that, at least for me, changes how I relate to what I build.

This post has been a good example of what I talk about in it: iterate, discard, go back and forth until I like it. I hope it's the first of many.

If you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by.
