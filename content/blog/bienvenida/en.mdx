I'd been going back and forth on having my own space online for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more... mine.

2025 has been a year of intense professional growth. I've taken on more responsibilities leading teams, given talks at conferences, dug deep into how to integrate AI into real development workflows. And somewhere along the way, I realized I had things to say. Thoughts that kept getting stuck in hallway conversations or scattered notes that never went anywhere.

So here we are.

## Why this website

The motivation is simple: I wanted a **living CV**. A site that evolves with me, that reflects not just what I've done, but how I think. Traditional resumes are static snapshots. This aims to be something more dynamic.

There's also a part about **building a personal brand**. I don't mean textbook *personal branding* with content strategies and editorial calendars. I mean having a place where, if someone wants to know who I am professionally, they can get the real picture.

But above all, I want to **share knowledge**. I've learned a lot over these years —about teams, product, technology, and yeah, mistakes— and I think some of that can be useful to others.

## On the building process

I built this site in a matter of hours. Yes, hours. Not because it's simple (I think it packs quite a visual punch), but because I wanted to push the limits of AI-assisted development.

It's been a fascinating experiment. The iteration speed you get when you use these tools right is insane. Try an idea, throw it out, try another, refine... all in a very tight loop. This is the kind of development that gets me excited: fast, visual, instant feedback.

I wanted the design to be bold. No generic templates. Something with personality, that shows there's someone behind it who actually cares about the details.

## What you'll find here

Honestly, a bit of everything. Thoughts on:

- **Technical leadership and teams**: What I learn day-to-day managing developers.
- **Product**: That mindset I try to keep —that code should serve something beyond passing tests.
- **Technology**: React, architecture, testing, whatever comes up.
- **AI applied to development**: Context Engineering, tools, workflows.
- **Software philosophy**: The uncomfortable questions about how we build software and why.

I don't have a publishing schedule. I'm not going to promise you a post every week. I'll publish when I have something worth saying. Hopefully this won't be the first and last, but I'm not going to force content just to fill space either.

If you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by. This is just getting started.
