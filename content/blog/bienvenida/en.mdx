I'd been going back and forth on having my own space online for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more... mine.

2025 has been a year of intense professional growth. It's helped me keep learning about technology, teams, product, and—especially—AI. Somewhere along the way, I realized I had things to say. Thoughts that kept getting stuck in hallway conversations or scattered notes that never went anywhere.

So here we are.

## Why this website

The motivation is simple: I wanted a space where ideas don't just sit in scattered notes. A site that evolves, that reflects not just what I've done, but how I think about things. Private notes collect dust. Writing in public—or preparing a talk—forces you to structure, to defend, to improve.

There's also a practical side: having a place where, if someone wants to know how I think professionally, they can get the real picture. Not textbook _personal branding_ with content strategies and editorial calendars. Something more organic.

But above all, I want to **share what I learn**. Over these years I've accumulated thoughts on teams, product, technology, and yeah, mistakes. If any of it helps you dodge a stumble or see a problem from a different angle, then the post was worth writing.

## On the building process

I built this site in a matter of hours. Yes, hours. Not because it's simple (I think it packs quite a visual punch), but because I wanted to push the limits of AI-assisted development.

It's been a fascinating experiment. The iteration speed you get when you use these tools right is insane. Try an idea, throw it out, try another, refine... all in a very tight loop. This is the kind of development that gets me excited: fast, visual, instant feedback.

I wanted the design to be bold. No generic templates. Something with personality, that shows there's someone behind it who actually cares about the details.

## What you'll find here

Honestly, a bit of everything. Thoughts on:

- **Technical leadership and teams**: What I learn day-to-day managing developers.
- **Product**: That mindset I try to keep —that code should serve something beyond passing tests.
- **Technology**: React, architecture, testing, whatever comes up.
- **AI applied to development**: Context Engineering, tools, workflows.
- **Software philosophy**: The uncomfortable questions about how we build software and why.

If you're interested in how to make a technical team work better, or how AI can change the way you develop, you'll probably find something useful here.

I don't have a publishing schedule. I'm not going to promise you a post every week. I'll publish when I have something worth saying. Hopefully this won't be the first and last, but I'm not going to force content just to fill space either.

If you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by. This is just getting started.
