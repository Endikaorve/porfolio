I've been thinking about having my own space on the internet for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more... mine.

2025 has been a year of intense professional growth. I've taken on more responsibilities leading teams, I've given talks at conferences, I've deeply explored how to integrate AI into real development workflows. And somewhere along the way, I realized I had things to share. Reflections that stayed in hallway conversations or scattered notes that never went anywhere.

So here we are.

## Why this website

The motivation is simple: I wanted a **living CV**. A site that evolves with me, that reflects not just what I've done, but how I think. Traditional resumes are static snapshots. This aspires to be something more dynamic.

There's also a part about **building a personal brand**. I don't mean textbook *personal branding* with content strategy and editorial calendars. I mean having a place where, if someone wants to know who I am professionally, they can get a real picture.

But above all, I want to **share knowledge**. I've learned a lot over these years —about teams, product, technology, mistakes— and I believe some of that knowledge can be useful to others.

## About the building process

I built this website in a few hours. Yes, hours. Not because it's a simple site (I think it has quite a visual punch), but because I wanted to test the full potential of AI-assisted development.

It's been a fascinating experiment. The iteration speed you achieve when you use these tools well is brutal. You can try ideas, discard them, try others, refine... all in a very short cycle. This is the kind of development that excites me: fast, visual, with immediate feedback.

I wanted the design to be bold. No generic templates. Something with personality, that conveys there's someone behind it who cares about the details.

## What you'll find here

Honestly, a bit of everything. Reflections on:

- **Technical leadership and teams**: What I learn day-to-day managing developers.
- **Product**: That mindset I try to maintain that code serves something beyond passing tests.
- **Technology**: React, architecture, testing, whatever comes up.
- **AI applied to development**: Context Engineering, tools, workflows.
- **Software philosophy**: The uncomfortable questions about how we build software and why.

I don't have a publishing schedule. I won't promise you a post every week. I'll publish when I have something worth sharing. I hope this isn't the first and last, but I'm not going to force content just to fill space.

If you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by. This is just getting started.
