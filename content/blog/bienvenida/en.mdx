title: 'AI does everything. That satisfies no longer enough.'
description: 'Reflections on building software when code is free.'

I'd been wanting my own space online for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more mine.

And I was curious to see what would happen if I built it using everything I already know about AI. I use it daily at work, but in large projects with clear rules and business constraints. I wanted to test it on something where I had absolute control from the start.

These are the reflections I'm taking away.

## The default is generic

Today any developer is 5 prompts away from having a nice personal website. Hero with gradient, cards with icons, smooth entrance animations. It works. It's correct. And it smells like AI from the first scroll.

When I started, I asked V0 to generate a landing page. It gave me exactly that: something correct, generic, soulless. A template with my data. I could have published it as is. But it wasn't mine.

## The director's job

There's a phrase that gets repeated a lot: "AI is a multiplier. If you wrote garbage code before, now you'll write it 10x." It's true. But there's another multiplier that gets less attention: the drive.

The curious person, the one who likes to build, now has a toy that didn't exist before. And they want to use it. Any excuse is good enough. In these past months I've coded more than in years.

But coding more doesn't mean coding better. AI can do everything. That doesn't mean it does it well or makes it yours.

This portfolio has about 190 commits. In 7 effective days of work (not consecutive). I didn't write a single line of code manually. But I also didn't accept the first thing the AI gave me. Or the second. Or often the tenth.

It's director's work. 50/50. The AI generates, I decide. Reject. Ask for something else. Give context. Iterate.

## ABC vs exploration

In my day-to-day, in projects with clear rules, AI is devastating. Predictable code, one-shots, bread and butter stuff. For that it's spectacular.

But this portfolio wasn't that. I didn't know where it was going until I got into it. I didn't want one-shots, they weren't helping. I wanted to try things, discard them, try others. Total babystepping.

Two ways of building with AI. Both valid. Both require different skills.

## The taste

Linus Torvalds talked about *taste* as the ability to see patterns where others see code. Something similar happens when you work with AI.

Over time you start to "sense" where it's going to go. You know what not to say so you don't influence it. What to say even when it seems unnecessary. When to stop and when to keep iterating.

It's not a framework. It's not a method. It's something you develop by using it.

## What you build along the way

For the AI to understand what I want, I had to understand it myself first. Define how I write. How I think. What I reject. What represents me.

That turned into documents. A `/me` that explains who I am. A design philosophy that defines what this site is and isn't. Context that the AI needs to stop giving me the generic stuff.

I didn't start with that. It emerged from necessity. From the process.

## What it left me with

It had been a while since I'd felt this eager to build software. The short feedback loop, being able to try ideas without the cost of before, watching something take shape in minutes... it's addictive.

I don't know if this is the first of many posts or the only one. No schedule. I'll publish when I have something worth saying.

Thanks for stopping by. This is just getting started.
