description: 'Reflections after building a portfolio in 2026.'

I'd been going back and forth on having my own space online for a while. Not a LinkedIn profile. Not a PDF resume. Something more... mine.

Building something like this today is easier than ever. I've been using AI in my day-to-day for a while now —large projects, clear rules, business constraints— and there's something that hooks you: the speed, being able to try ideas without the cost of before. I keep wanting to build more things. Any excuse is a good one, and this was perfect: something of my own, with full control from the start.

These are the reflections I'm taking away.

## The default is generic

Today any developer is 5 prompts away from having a nice personal website. Hero with gradient, cards with icons, smooth entrance animations, fully responsive. It works. It's correct. And it smells like AI from the first scroll.

When I started, as usual, I asked V0. It gave me exactly that: something correct, generic, soulless. A template with my data. I could have published it as is and nothing would have happened. It was fine. But it wasn't mine.

## Two ways of building

In my day-to-day, in projects with clear rules, AI is devastating. Predictable code, one-shots, bread and butter stuff. For that it's spectacular.

But this portfolio wasn't that. I didn't know where it was going until I got into it. I didn't want one-shots, they weren't helping. It's a different kind of building. And it requires a different way of working.

## The feedback loop

With AI you can validate an idea in minutes. Keep what works, discard what doesn't, ask for variations, combine parts from different responses. That used to have a cost. Now it's almost free.

This portfolio has about 190 commits. In about 28 hours of effective work. Small steps, one after another. I didn't write a single line of code manually. But I also didn't accept the first thing the AI gave me. Or the second. Or often the tenth.

The AI generates. I direct. Reject, ask for something else, give context, iterate. But for that cycle to work, the AI has to understand what I'm looking for.

## Building context

For the AI to give me what I want, I had to understand it myself first. Define how I write. How I think. What I reject. What represents me.

And I'm not just talking about code. In a website, the container matters as much as the content. The architecture, the design, the animations. But also the copy, the tone, the way you tell things. Everything has to be coherent. It has to feel personal.

That turned into documents. A `/me` command that explains who I am. A design philosophy that defines what this site is and isn't. Style guides for the writing. Context that the AI needs to stop giving me the generic stuff.

I didn't start with that. It emerged from necessity. From the process of iterating and seeing that without that context, the responses wouldn't converge.

## _Taste_, here too

Linus Torvalds talked about _taste_ as the ability to see patterns where others see code. Something similar happens when you work with AI.

Over time you start to "sense" where it's going to go. You know what not to say so you don't influence it. What to say even when it seems unnecessary. When to stop and when to keep iterating.

It's not a framework. It's not a method. It's something you develop by using it.

## What it left me with

There's a phrase that gets repeated a lot: "AI is a multiplier". But there's another multiplier that gets less attention: the drive.

The curious person, the one who likes to build, now has a toy that didn't exist before. And they want to use it. It had been a while since I'd felt this eager to build software. The short feedback loop, being able to try ideas without the cost of before, watching something take shape in minutes... it's addictive.

I don't know if this is the first of many posts or the only one. No schedule. I'll publish when I have something worth saying.

Thanks for stopping by. This is just getting started.
